Dwarf: (muttering) Stuck in this wretched room... I need to find a way out!
Dwarf: What's this? A broken shield? Perhaps it holds the key to my escape.
Dwarf: There must be four pieces to complete this shield. But where could they be hidden?

Kiff:  Hmm, looks like I'm in quite a pickle. But I won't give up!
Kiff:  Ah, those chandeliers could be my ticket out of here!
Kiff:  Alright, time to put my jumping skills to the test!
Kiff:  One down, a few more to go!
Kiff:  I'm getting closer! Just a few more leaps!
Kiff:  Hmm, maybe this needs fuel to work.
